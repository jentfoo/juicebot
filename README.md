# juicebot #
juicebot is a simple, and fast library for creating IRC bots using [Netty](http://www.netty.io). It provides a very simple API for creating an IRC bot, and a simple utility set for working with them. It all starts with extending one of the included bot bases, such as Bot, and overriding the onMessage method.
